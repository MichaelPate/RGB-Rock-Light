# RGB Rock Light
 RGB LED decoration for a big crystal. This code is designed for an ATTiny85. Its meant to be powered over USB and just sits around as a decoration.
 This is currently v2 of the design. It uses the built in EEPROM library, the Adafruit NeoPixel library, and the ATTiny board manager URL from:
 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damellis/attiny/ide-1.6.x-boards-manager/package_damellis_attiny_index.json

To program the board more easily, I designed a programmer shield for an Arduino Uno that lets me use a programming cable on JST PH headers.
See the link below to that repo.

I will eventually get around to designing an enclosure for this. When that happens, ill put it on thingiverse and add the link here!
